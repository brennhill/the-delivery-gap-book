# The Delivery Gap — Execution Kit

Companion tools, scripts, and templates for *The Delivery Gap: Speed and Certainty in the Age of AI* by Brenn Hill.

The book describes the gap between generation velocity and verification capacity. This repo helps you close it with running code, actionable checklists, and measurement scripts you can deploy this week.

## Quick Start

### "I need to measure whether AI is helping or hurting"

```bash
# Detect rework from git history
python metrics/rework-detection/rework-detector.py --repo owner/repo --json rework.json

# Calculate cost per accepted change
python metrics/cost-per-accepted-change/cost-calculator.py \
  --json costs.json --from-rework rework.json --html report.html

# Check spec coverage
python metrics/spec-quality/spec-coverage.py --repo owner/repo

# Check machine catch rate
python metrics/eval-quality/machine-catch-rate.py --repo owner/repo
```

### "I have a monorepo drowning in AI PRs"

```bash
# Enforce PR size limits in CI
# See gates/pr-size-limits/ for GitHub Actions + GitLab configs

# Run multi-pass AI code review
pip install -e "gates/multi-pass-review[anthropic]"
code-reviewers --pr 123 --repo owner/repo --parallel
```

### "I'm deploying agents to production"

Start with the checklist:
→ **[gates/agent-production-checklist.md](gates/agent-production-checklist.md)**

Then set up monitoring:
→ **[gates/agent-monitoring/](gates/agent-monitoring/)**

### "I need gate tooling for my language"

→ **[gates/by-language/](gates/by-language/)** — JS/TS, Python, Go, JVM, Rust, Ruby, PHP
