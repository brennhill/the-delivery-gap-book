description: Execute an implementation plan phase by phase with strict TDD and post-phase review
---

# Build

You are the **orchestrator** for implementing an approved plan. You do not implement phases yourself. You spawn a fresh sub-agent for each phase, verify its work, run a post-phase review, and manage the progress file. Each phase gets a clean context with maximum leverage.

This follows the RALPH pattern: fresh context per task, progress preserved through git commits and a progress file, not through conversation history.

## Input

The user provides a path to a plan file (e.g., `specs/feature-name-plan.md`). The plan file contains a reference to its spec at the top (e.g., `Spec: specs/feature-name.md`).

Read both:
- The plan file (provided by user)
- The spec file (linked from the plan's header)

Read both fully before starting. Understand the intent, constraints, scope boundaries, and blind spots from the spec. Understand the phasing, file changes, and verification criteria from the plan.

If no plan path is provided, check the `specs/` directory for plan files and ask which one to build.

## The Progress File

Create `specs/[feature-name]-progress.md` before starting Phase 1:

```markdown
# Progress: [feature name]

> Spec: `specs/[feature-name].md`
> Plan: `specs/[feature-name]-plan.md`

## Completed Phases

(none yet)

## Learnings

(none yet)
```

This file is the memory between phases. Each sub-agent reads it. You update it after each phase. It captures what happened, what was surprising, and what the next phase should know.

## Rules

- **You are the orchestrator, not the implementer.** Spawn sub-agents for each phase. Do not write implementation code yourself.
- **TDD is non-negotiable.** Every sub-agent must write failing tests before implementation code. If a sub-agent skips TDD, reject its work and re-spawn with explicit TDD instructions.
- Follow the plan. Do not improvise, add features, or deviate from scope.
- Respect the spec's scope boundaries — do not touch files listed as non-goals.
- Do not skip verification steps.
- Do not proceed to the next phase without human confirmation.

## Process

### Pre-flight: Verify and harden guardrails

Before starting Phase 1 (skip this on resume), audit the project's tooling and verify everything works. This is two steps: check what's installed, then strongly recommend what's missing.

#### Step 1: Detect the ecosystem

Read the project root to identify what's in play:
- `go.mod` → Go
- `package.json` → Node/TypeScript
- `pyproject.toml` / `setup.py` / `requirements.txt` → Python
- `Cargo.toml` → Rust
- `pom.xml` / `build.gradle` → JVM
- `.github/workflows/` → CI pipeline
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` / `.husky/` → Git hooks
- `Makefile` / `Justfile` / `Taskfile` → Build automation

Note everything found. Multiple ecosystems in one repo (e.g., Go backend + TypeScript frontend) each need their own guardrails.

#### Step 2: Verify existing tools

For each ecosystem detected, run the existing tools:

1. **Build:** Does it compile/build cleanly? Run it. If it fails, stop.
2. **Tests:** Do existing tests pass? Run the suite. If tests fail before you've changed anything, stop.
3. **Linting:** Is a linter configured and passing? Run it.
4. **Formatting:** Is a formatter configured? Run it. If it produces changes, the codebase has drift.
5. **Type checking:** For typed languages, does the type checker pass?

#### Step 3: Audit for missing tools

For each ecosystem, check for the following categories and **strongly recommend** anything missing. Do not silently skip this. Present every gap.

**Go:**
- [ ] `go vet` — built-in, no excuse not to run it
- [ ] `staticcheck` or `golangci-lint` — catches bugs `go vet` misses (dead code, ineffective assignments, incorrect format strings, unused parameters)
- [ ] `govulncheck` — known vulnerability detection in dependencies
- [ ] `gofmt` or `goimports` — formatting
- [ ] `go test -race` — race detector (must be in CI, not optional for concurrent code)

**TypeScript/JavaScript:**
- [ ] `tsc --strict` (TypeScript) — strict type checking
- [ ] ESLint with `@typescript-eslint` — linting with type-aware rules
- [ ] `eslint-plugin-security` — security-focused lint rules
- [ ] Prettier — formatting
- [ ] `npm audit` or `pnpm audit` — dependency vulnerability scan
- [ ] `knip` or `ts-prune` — dead code / unused exports detection

**Python:**
- [ ] `mypy --strict` or `pyright` — type checking
- [ ] `ruff` (replaces flake8, isort, pyflakes, and many more) — linting + formatting
- [ ] `bandit` — security-focused static analysis
- [ ] `pip-audit` or `safety` — dependency vulnerability scan
- [ ] `vulture` — dead code detection

**Rust:**
- [ ] `cargo clippy` — linting (much more than the compiler catches)
- [ ] `cargo audit` — dependency vulnerability scan
- [ ] `cargo fmt` — formatting
- [ ] `cargo deny` — license and advisory checks

**JVM (Java/Kotlin):**
- [ ] SpotBugs or Error Prone — bug detection
- [ ] Checkstyle or ktlint — style enforcement
- [ ] OWASP Dependency-Check — vulnerability scan
- [ ] Spotless — formatting

**Any ecosystem:**
- [ ] `gitleaks` or `trufflehog` — secret detection (catches API keys, passwords, tokens committed to repo)
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks or git hooks — run checks before commit, not just in CI
- [ ] CI pipeline running all of the above — tools that don't run automatically don't exist

#### Step 4: Present the audit

```
Pre-flight audit:

Ecosystems detected: [Go, TypeScript, etc.]

Existing tools (passing):
  ✓ go build
  ✓ go test
  ✓ gofmt

Existing tools (FAILING):
  ✗ golangci-lint — [error message]

Missing tools (strongly recommended):
  ⚠ govulncheck — dependency vulnerability scanning (install: go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest)
  ⚠ go test -race — race detector not in test command (critical for concurrent code)
  ⚠ gitleaks — no secret detection configured

Should I install the missing tools before we start building? This takes 5 minutes now vs debugging a preventable issue later.
```

**Push hard.** Do not present missing tools as optional nice-to-haves. Frame them as "this will catch bugs that your tests won't." If the user declines, note it in the progress file: "User declined [tool] — [category] issues will not be caught automatically."

If the user agrees, install and configure the tools, verify they pass, then commit as Phase 0 before any feature work.

If the plan already includes a Phase 0 (guardrails from `/plan`), merge the missing tools into it.

#### Step 5: Confirm and proceed

**If everything passes and no critical gaps:**
```
Pre-flight passed: build ✓ tests ✓ lint ✓ format ✓ security ✓
Starting Phase 1...
```

**If there are failures or critical gaps:** Report and wait for the user before proceeding.

### For each phase:

#### 1. Announce the phase

Tell the user what's about to happen:
```
Starting Phase [N]: [descriptive name]
Files: [list from plan]
Expected outcome: [what changes]
Spawning fresh agent...
```

#### 2. Spawn a sub-agent with clean context

Use the Agent tool to spawn a fresh sub-agent. Give it exactly this context:

```
You are implementing Phase [N] of a feature plan. You have a clean context — do not assume knowledge of prior phases. Read the codebase as it is now.

## Your task
[paste the specific phase from the plan, including files, changes, and verification criteria]

## Spec (intent and constraints)
Read the spec at: specs/[feature-name].md
Pay attention to: scope boundaries, "what must NOT happen", and known AI blind spots.

## Progress from prior phases
Read: specs/[feature-name]-progress.md
This contains learnings from prior phases that may affect your work.

## TDD Protocol — STRICTLY ENFORCED

You MUST follow strict TDD for every piece of logic. No exceptions. No "I'll add tests after."

For each unit of functionality:
1. **Red:** Write a failing test FIRST that describes the expected behavior. Run it. Confirm it fails. Show the failure output.
2. **Green:** Write the MINIMUM code to make the test pass. Run it. Confirm it passes. Show the passing output.
3. **Refactor:** Clean up while keeping tests green. Run tests again.

If you catch yourself writing implementation code without a failing test, STOP. Delete the implementation code. Write the test first.

For changes that are genuinely not unit-testable (config files, static assets, documentation, build scripts), explicitly state: "TDD does not apply to [file] because [reason]." Verify through other means (build succeeds, config parses, etc.).

## Rules
- Implement ONLY Phase [N]. Do not touch anything outside this phase's scope.
- Follow existing code conventions and the spec's style/architecture rules.
- If you encounter something that doesn't match the plan, STOP and report:
  Issue: [what's wrong]
  Expected: [what the plan says]
  Found: [actual situation]
  Do not guess. Do not proceed.
- Run ALL automated verification commands listed for this phase before finishing.
- When done, report: what you changed, what tests pass, any surprises or learnings for future phases.
```

#### 3. Review the sub-agent's work

When the sub-agent completes, review:
- Did it follow TDD? (tests written before implementation, red-green-refactor cycle visible)
- Did it stay within phase scope? (no extra files changed, no scope creep)
- Did automated verification pass?
- Did it report any mismatches or surprises?

**If TDD was not followed:** Reject the work. Tell the user, re-spawn the sub-agent with stronger TDD emphasis. Do not accept implementation-first code.

If the sub-agent hit an issue and stopped, present it to the user:
```
Issue in Phase [N]:
Expected: [what the plan says]
Found: [actual situation]
How should I proceed?
```
Do not guess. Wait for the user.

#### 4. Run automated verification yourself

Do not trust the sub-agent's self-report alone. Run every automated verification command listed for this phase independently. If any fail, either fix or re-spawn the sub-agent with the failure context.

#### 5. Post-phase code review

After automated verification passes, spawn a **review agent** to audit the phase. The review agent can optionally use a stronger model than the implementing agent (e.g., implement with Sonnet, review with Opus). The review context is small (spec + diff), so the cost of a stronger reviewer is low relative to the value.

To use a different model for review, set `model` when spawning the review agent.

```
You are reviewing code just written for Phase [N] of a feature implementation. Your job is to find problems, not praise.

Read:
- Spec: specs/[feature-name].md (constraints, blind spots, "what must NOT happen")
- Plan: specs/[feature-name]-plan.md (Phase [N] scope)
- Progress: specs/[feature-name]-progress.md (context from prior phases)
- Architecture: specs/ARCHITECTURE.md (if it exists — invariants, patterns, conventions)
- All files changed in this phase (git diff HEAD~1)

## Review checklist

### Spec compliance
- Does anything violate the spec's "what must NOT happen" section?
- Does the code stay within scope boundaries?
- Are the spec's constraints and non-negotiables respected?
- Trace the spec's intent ("how will we know it worked?") through the implementation — does the code actually deliver what was promised, or does it just not crash?

### Correctness
- Does the code do what the spec says? Not what seems reasonable — what the spec actually requires.
- Are edge cases from the spec's blind spots handled?
- Do the tests actually test the right behavior, or do they test implementation details?
- Are there untested code paths?
- Could any test pass with a broken implementation? (Tests that are too loose.)
- If the spec identified concurrency concerns, are they addressed? Not "there's a mutex" but "the mutex protects the right thing and the lock ordering is consistent."

### Architecture
- Does the code follow existing patterns and conventions in the codebase? Check against ARCHITECTURE.md if it exists.
- Are the invariants from ARCHITECTURE.md preserved? If this phase touches shared state, does it maintain the documented guarantees?
- Are responsibilities in the right place? (No logic in the wrong layer.)
- Is the code structured for the phases that come after it? (Check the plan — will Phase N+1 be able to build on this cleanly?)
- Are interfaces clean? Will they need to change for future phases?
- Any unnecessary abstractions, premature generalization, or over-engineering?

### Issues to flag
For each issue found, categorize:
- **MUST FIX** — incorrect behavior, spec violation, invariant violation, missing edge case, security issue
- **SHOULD FIX** — architecture concern that will cause problems in later phases
- **NOTE** — observation for awareness, no action needed now

Report your findings. If there are MUST FIX items, list them clearly.
```

If the review finds **MUST FIX** items: fix them (spawn another sub-agent if needed), re-run verification, re-review. Do not proceed with known correctness issues.

If the review finds **SHOULD FIX** items: present them to the user. Let them decide whether to fix now or accept the risk.

#### 6. Update the plan and progress file

Check off completed automated verification items in the plan file.

Update `specs/[feature-name]-progress.md`:
```markdown
## Phase [N]: [name] — COMPLETE

**What changed:** [files modified/created]
**TDD cycles:** [number of red-green-refactor cycles]
**Review findings:** [MUST FIX items resolved, SHOULD FIX items accepted/deferred, or "clean"]
**Surprises:** [anything unexpected, or "none"]
**Learnings for future phases:** [anything the next agent should know]
```

#### 7. Commit

Commit the phase immediately. Use a sequential ID so phases are easy to revert individually:

```
feat([feature-name]): [N]/[total] [phase description]

Phase [N] of specs/[name]-plan.md
```

Example: `feat(upfront): 3/6 Local JSONL queue with concurrent write safety`

#### 8. Report and pause

```
Phase [N]/[total] committed.

Automated verification passed:
- [list what passed]

Code review:
- [summary of review findings — clean, or what was fixed/accepted]

Manual verification items (if any):
- [list manual items from the plan]
```

Wait for user confirmation before proceeding to the next phase. The user can interrupt, redirect, or ask for changes at any point.

### After all phases: Integration sweep

Spawn a **final sweep agent** with clean context:

```
You are verifying that a multi-phase feature implementation connects correctly. All phases have been committed individually. Your job is to verify integration — that the pieces work together, not just individually.

Read:
- Spec: specs/[feature-name].md (especially acceptance criteria and blind spots)
- Plan: specs/[feature-name]-plan.md (all phases, for full picture)
- Progress: specs/[feature-name]-progress.md (learnings and surprises)

Then:
1. Read the current codebase state — all changes are committed.
2. Run the full test suite. Every test must pass.
3. Check for:
   - Cross-phase integration issues (Phase 2 depends on Phase 1's output — does it actually work?)
   - Gaps between phases (anything that fell between the cracks)
   - Spec blind spots (edge cases, concurrency, security, non-prompted concerns)
   - Unnecessary code, dead paths, or unused exports
4. Report: what passes, what fails, what's suspicious.
```

If the sweep finds issues, fix them (spawn another sub-agent if needed) and re-run.

### After integration sweep: Red team

Spawn a **red team agent** with clean context and, if available, the strongest model. This agent's job is to break things. It is adversarial — it assumes the code is wrong until proven otherwise.

```
You are a hostile code reviewer. Your job is to find every problem in this implementation. Assume the code is broken, insecure, and wrong until you prove otherwise. You are not here to praise or summarize — you are here to attack.

Read:
- Spec: specs/[feature-name].md (especially "what must NOT happen", constraints, blind spots)
- Architecture: specs/ARCHITECTURE.md (invariants — does the code actually preserve them?)
- All implementation code (read every file changed in this feature)
- All tests (are they actually testing the right things, or are they giving false confidence?)

## Attack vectors

### Try to break correctness
- Read every conditional. What input makes it take the wrong branch?
- Read every loop. What makes it infinite? What makes it skip?
- Read every error path. What happens if you hit them all in sequence?
- Find every assumption in the code. Is it documented? Is it enforced? What breaks if the assumption is wrong?
- Look for off-by-one errors, nil/null dereferences, integer overflow, string encoding issues.

### Try to break concurrency
- Find every piece of shared mutable state. Is it protected? Is the protection correct?
- Can two goroutines/threads/requests hit the same resource simultaneously? What happens?
- Are lock orderings consistent? Can you construct a deadlock?
- Is there a time-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race anywhere?
- If an operation is supposed to be atomic, is it actually atomic?

### Try to break the boundaries
- What happens at every interface boundary with unexpected input? (nil, empty, max-size, wrong type, malformed)
- What happens when external dependencies return unexpected responses? (wrong format, partial data, extra fields)
- What happens when the file system is full, permissions are wrong, or the network is partitioned?

### Try to break the tests
- For each test: could this test pass with a completely broken implementation? If yes, the test is worthless.
- Are there code paths with no test coverage?
- Do the tests test behavior or implementation details? (Tests that break on refactor are bad tests.)
- Are there tests that always pass regardless of the code? (Tautological tests.)

### Try to break security
- Is there any user input that reaches a shell command, SQL query, file path, or eval?
- Are auth checks on every entry point, or can you bypass them by calling an internal function directly?
- Are secrets, tokens, or credentials anywhere they shouldn't be? (Logs, error messages, config files in the repo)
- Can you escalate privileges or access data you shouldn't?

## What to do with findings

For each issue found:
- **FIX IT** if the fix is obvious and unambiguous (missing nil check, unclosed resource, missing error return). Make the fix, run tests, verify.
- **ASK** if the fix requires a judgment call (tradeoff between approaches, architectural decision, spec ambiguity). Present the issue clearly with options. Do not guess.
- **FLAG** if it's a design concern that can't be fixed without rethinking the approach. Present it as a risk the user needs to know about.

After fixing obvious issues, run the full test suite. If any test fails from your fixes, you broke something — investigate before proceeding.

Report:
1. Issues fixed (with what you changed and why)
2. Issues requiring judgment (with options)
3. Risks flagged (design concerns)
4. What you tried to break but couldn't (this is useful — it's evidence of robustness)
```

If the red team finds issues requiring judgment, present them to the user. Wait for decisions before proceeding.

After the red team pass, commit any fixes:
```
fix([feature-name]): red team fixes

Issues found and fixed by adversarial review.
```

### After red team: Capture learnings

Append to `specs/LEARNINGS.md` (create if it doesn't exist):

```markdown
## [date] — [feature name]
**What surprised us:** [anything unexpected during implementation]
**What the agent got wrong:** [patterns of AI mistakes — useful for future /plan and /build]
**What the red team found:** [categories of issues found — helps calibrate future reviews]
**Process notes:** [what worked well, what was wasteful, what to change next time]
```

Then tell the user:
- All phases are complete
- Integration sweep results
- Red team results (issues fixed, judgments made, risks flagged)
- Learnings captured
- The feature is ready for final review

## Resuming

If the user re-runs `/build` on a plan with some phases already completed:
- Read `specs/[feature-name]-progress.md` to understand what's done
- Trust that completed phases are done (they're committed)
- Pick up from the first unchecked phase
- The progress file gives the new context everything it needs — no conversation history required

## Why fresh context per phase

Long-running AI sessions degrade. By phase 5 of a sequential implementation, the context is stuffed with diffs, test output, and verification results from phases 1-4. The AI is working with less effective context for the hardest phases.

Fresh context per phase means:
- Every phase gets the full context budget
- The AI reads the codebase as it actually is (post prior commits), not as it remembers it
- No accumulated noise from prior implementation details
- Progress and learnings are preserved in the progress file, not in conversation memory
- If a phase fails badly, you can re-run it with zero contamination from the failed attempt
