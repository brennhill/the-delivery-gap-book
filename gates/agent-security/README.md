## Cost Controls & Budget Enforcement (OWASP #8 Lifecycle, #10 Observability)

Runaway agent costs are a security problem, not just a finance problem. An agent in an infinite loop or exploring outside its scope burns budget that signals something is wrong.

| Tool | What it does | OSS | URL |
|------|-------------|-----|-----|
| Stripe `@stripe/token-meter` | Per-call cost calculation across OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini. Billing integration. | Yes (MIT) | https://github.com/stripe/ai |
| LiteLLM Proxy | Budget limits per project/key/model. Spend alerts. Rate limiting. | Yes (MIT) | https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/proxy/cost_tracking |
| Azure AI Gateway | `llm-token-limit` policies. Per-project TPM quotas. Hard caps on token consumption. | No | https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/llm-token-limit-policy |
| Portkey | Per-request cost estimation. Budget alerts and rate limits. | No | https://portkey.ai |

### SDK-level caps

Every major agent SDK has built-in budget parameters. Set at least two per agent run:

| SDK | Turn limit | Default |
|-----|-----------|---------|
| OpenAI Agents SDK | `max_turns` | 10 |
| LangGraph | `recursion_limit` | 25 |
| CrewAI | `max_iter` + `max_execution_time` | 25 |
| Anthropic | `budget_tokens` (thinking) | varies |

For full implementation details, see [../agent-monitoring/README.md](../agent-monitoring/README.md#step-6-track-iteration-budget-per-run).

## Inter-Agent Identity & Trust (OWASP #5, #9)

| Tool | What it does | OSS | URL |
|------|-------------|-----|-----|
| SPIFFE / SPIRE | Cryptographic identity for agents | Yes (Apache 2.0) | https://spiffe.io |
| Google A2A Protocol | Agent-to-agent communication standard | Emerging | https://google.github.io/A2A/ |
